## Description
The purpose of this work is the development of an automatic tool for measuring attachment styles and personality patterns, that is, according to attachment theory, Shedler-Westen Personality Taxonomy, and the Big Five traits. This work presents the development of an innovative automatic tool designed for the analysis of attachment styles, personality patterns and traits. Criticizing existing diagnostic methods for biases and inefficiencies, the study introduces a novel AI-based tool that employs natural language processing to perform remote, dynamic, and unbiased analysis of attachment and personality patterns.   
* Some of the examples here demonstrate the tool's capability to accurately classify text into distinct attachment styles and personality patterns. This is evidenced by its successful application in analyzing dialogues where it identified correlations between characters attachment styles over time. The tool's effectiveness is further corroborated by a 100% accuracy rate in classifying sentences from established questionnaires into correct attachment styles, showcasing its potential to transform the understanding and assessment of psychological constructs in a more efficient and unbiased manner.   
* Classifying the text into one of the four attachment styles for example is a process which mainly includes the use of the GPT language model. To begin the classification process, the model receives the transcribed text from the episode or series. The text is actually the dialogues that take place between the characters in the serieswhere each sentence in the text belongs to a certain character and is marked as such in advance. Along with the dialogue, the model also receive  Bartholomew's definitions of the four attachment  styles as an input for example. After defining the input it reads the dialogues, paying close attention to what each character says, to the emotional context and the style of attachments that they express - all this based on the defined article.

### Validation:
The model based on its understanding of the dialogues and  the attachment styles determines how well each attachment style fits the way each character speaks. It does this by calculating a probability score that ranges from 0 to 1 for each of the four attachment styles. A score of 1 means that the character's dialogues or text fully matches a certainat attachment  style, while a score of 0 means that there is no match at all. All this he analyzes each segment separately andindependently (The number of segments is predefined) â€“ In the end, each character is assigned a specific attachment style based on their dialogues. This output (fetched to a data file) can then be visualized on a graph, showing the change in styles during the episode or series. 
We would also like to validate the model to check that it works as expected. In this case we check if the model can correctly classify sentences into the correct  attachmentstyles  we use sentences or items from questionnaires (The ASQ and the RSQ for example). In total we have 68 sentences or items, each of which corresponds to one of the four attachment styles. Then we ask the model to classify these sentences or items. The model reads each sentence or item and indicates which attachment style itbelieves the sentence is best suited to . Now we will compare the classifications of the model with the actual classifications known from the questionnaire. We do this using the Confusion Matrix which is a table that helps us understand and evaluatethe performance of the classification model. If the classification capabilities of the model are good, it must classify most (or all) of the sentences or items correctly. In  our case  itcorrectly classified all 68 sentences (100%).

</p>

It is possible to analyze different types of inputs. The personality patterns analysis can be performed in three ways: one option is an analysis of scenes and dialogues of multiple speakers, a second option is analyzing media contents concentrated in a folder, and a third option is of analyzing a single video file.

</p>

### Dialogue File:
1. We start with a video file or a movie from which we want to extract dialogues. Through a transcription process, we convert the auditory speech of the characters into text. This transcribed dialogue will serve as the primary input for our analysis. this is mainly done with AzureSpeech2SRT.py that can perform speaker diarization to recognize different speakers from audio.
2. Then we insert the transcribed dialogue into the GPT model, alongside Bartholomew's definitions of attachment styles from the article - Attachment styles among young adults: A test of a four-category model (1991).
3. The model calculates the probability of each piece or segment of dialogue or text for each of the four  attachment styles. The number of segments is predefined (less segments = analysis of more text per segment).
4. We instruct the model to produce a specific output. In this case, for each piece of dialogue or text, we want the model to assign each speaker or character a probability (from 0 to 1) for each attachment style. A score of 1 means that the dialogue perfectly matches a particular attachment style, and 0 means that there is no match at all.
5. After processing all parts of the dialog or text, the model produces a data set such as a CSV file that includes the probabilities for each attachment style for each part of the dialog or text. This data can then be visualized on a graph to examine changes in attachment styles over the film's timeline. This way we will get a dynamic description of the attachment styles of the characters during the film.

### Results: Scenes From A Marriage (Attachment Styles)
After receiving a data file of the results for the series, we would like to make a comparison between time points or dialogue segments in the series between the main characters. We can also see this graphically, by calculating correlations between the speakers and their attachment style at time points in the film. Correlations (Pearson or Spearman) were calculated between all attachment styles separately for character number 1, and all other attachment styles of character number 2 at all time points in the series. For example, we consider a correlation between the probabilistic values of anxious attachment for character number 1, and the probabilistic values of avoidant attachment for character number 2. In other words, we would like to check whether as the probability value in the series of anxious attachment for character number 1 increases, the probability of avoidant attachment for character Number 2 also increases.
Having run the algorithm on the whole series with 5 episodes, we now want to examine the results. we can see the graphs of each character separately in the attached image. The top graph belongs to Jonathan, while the bottom graph belongs to Mira. This graph shows a distribution of about 25 segments. The timecodes can be seen on the X-axis, with each segment of dialogue corresponding to a timecode. In each timecode there are probabilistic values of the call styles on the Y-axis. The highest values at a time point are highlighted with a thicker line. we can see that each color corresponds to an attachment style. The red markings describe the overlap in time points between the two characters and their attachment styles. It can be seen that when Jonathan expresses an avoidant attachment style, Mira expresses an anxious attachment style (green and orange colors). we can also see a response of an anxious attachment style on Jonathan's part, when Mira expresses a fearful-avoidant attachment style.

</p>

In the next image we can see a correlation table for the main characters in the movie Jonathan and Mira. It can be seen that there is a significant moderate correlation (p-value<0.001, r=0.41) between time points characterized by anxious attachment on the part of Jonathan and time points characterized by avoidant attachment on the part of Mira. It can also be seen that there is a significant medium-weak correlation (p-value<0.001 r=0.32) between time points characterized by avoidant attachment on the part of Jonathan and time points characterized by anxious attachment on the part of Mira.

### Media Folder:
Algorithms and other techniques are today able to extract a database of images or videos from specific profiles from social networks. If we have a folder with a large number of photos or videos (or both) of the same person, we can analyze all the images or videos in which he or she appears. Since this analysis is limited to visual analysis only, we use AI to extract visual features such as what the person looks like, what actions he does, what objects he interacts with, where he is, what clothes he wears, including their colors, and what emotions he expresses. After extracting these dimensions or features, we can analyze what kind of features are repeated in the images or videos, and as a result - try and extract personality patterns. All this as a way of relying on the fact that a person chose to be photographed in a certain way, to do a certain thing, and was photographed in a specific place, and to wear a certain style of clothing - All this can hint about his personality, that is, attachment styles, personality patterns, and big five traits. For example, a non-conformist combination of colors that stand out to the eye, including repeated photography at parties when the person is always surrounded by people can indicate an extroverted person who is open to experiences. It is important to emphasize that the algorithm calculates its results only based on the existing database available to us, when if it is limited - the results will not be reliable or relevant. Of course, the results are not absolute, and that it must be remembered that the person chooses in which situations to be photographed, or what to present to the public. It is assumed that these certain choices indicate or hint at his or her personality (for example, to be photographed in a beach instead at home, or with many friends instead of alone, and to wear black clothes instead of white). 

How the algorithm works:
1. Selecting input folder:
Selecting a folder that contains images or videos of the same person.
2. Getting descriptions:
Using AI to extract descriptions (in a csv file format) for each image or video file, that is: general description of the person, actions, objects, locations, clothing, and expressed emotions - using strict instructions or prompts.
3. Analyzing the descriptions:
Getting results using AI with tailored knowledge for the text with the descriptions of all images and videos from the selected folder.

### Video File:
If we want to analyze a single video file, when only one person appears and speaks in it, we will select this option. For example, when a person is interviewed and answers questions in a specific video clip. This algorithm is less "smart" compared to the one that analyzes scenes, in that it does not know how to separate speakers. In fact, it sees only one speaker before its eyes with one concentrated transcription. Therefore, it is not intended for analyzing videos that clearly contain more than one speaker. The algorithm relies on what the speaker in the video says, and extracts the results of his or her personality from a transcript it extracts from the audio of the video file. To make sure that only one speaker is actually heard in the video segment, it is recommended to edit it and remove speakers that are not relevant, and highlight only the speaker we want to analyze.

How the algorithm works:
1. Selecting input Video
Selecting a video with one speaker.
2. Video to text:
Transcribing the video into text using AI.
3. Analyzing the text:
Getting results using AI with tailored knowledge by using the transcription of the video.

## The Case of Elliot Rodger
<p align="left">
  <img src="assets/ElliotRodgerDriverLicense.jpg" alt="Alt text for image1" width="100"/>
</p>
Elliot Rodger was a 22-year-old man known for perpetrating the Isla Vista massacre near the University of California, Santa Barbara, on May 23, 2014. He killed six people and injured fourteen others before committing suicide. His actions were motivated by personal and social grievances, particularly his frustration over his perceived social and sexual rejection by women. Rodger left behind a manifesto and a series of YouTube videos detailing his thoughts and plans, which sparked widespread discussion about various social issues, including misogyny, mental health, and gun control laws. In order to implement the system, we would like to input, for example, transcribed textual content into the algorithm. This textual content does not come from a video file, but from a book written by Eliot Roger himself about himself - a biographical book. these are the output results:    

#### Attachment Styles:    
Secured: 0.1   
Anxious-Preoccupied: 0.3    
Dismissive-Avoidant: 0.1   
Fearful-Avoidant: 0.5   
Sentiment: -0.8   
Emotionality: 9   
Self: -10 | Others: -10   
Anxiety: 8   
Avoidance: 8   
   
Explanation: The dominant attachment style is Fearful-Avoidant, characterized by a negative view of both self and others, and a high level of anxiety and avoidance. Rodger expresses intense loneliness and a sense of rejection, coupled with a strong desire for acceptance and intimacy, yet simultaneously avoids and fears these very connections. He also demonstrates considerable anxiety about relationships and a profound avoidance of genuine intimacy.   
   
Sentence: "I am the true victim in all of this. I am the good guy. Humanity struck at me first by condemning me to experience so much suffering."   
   
#### Personality Disorders (according to Westen, Shedler, Bradley, and DeFife's taxonomy):   
Depressed: 3   
Paranoid: 4   
Schizoid-Schizotypal: 1   
Antisocial-Psychopathic: 4   
Borderline-Dysregulated: 3   
Narcissistic: 4   
Anxious-Avoidant: 3   
Dependent-Victimized: 2   
Obsessional: 1   
Hysteric-Histrionic: 1   
Sentiment: -0.8   
Emotionality: 9   
Depression: 0.9   
   
Explanation: Rodger's narrative shows a high match with Paranoid (4), Antisocial-Psychopathic (4), and Narcissistic (4) personality disorders. His deep mistrust, hostility towards others, and belief in widespread conspiracy against him align with Paranoid traits. His lack of empathy, manipulative and harmful behavior towards others, and grandiose sense of self-importance are indicative of Antisocial-Psychopathic and Narcissistic disorders.   
    
Sentence: "Humanity has never accepted me among them and now I know why. I am more than human. I am superior to them all. I am Elliot Rodgerâ€¦ Magnificent, glorious, supreme, eminentâ€¦ Divine!"    
   
#### Big Five Personality Traits:   
Extraversion: -8   
Agreeableness: -10   
Conscientiousness: 2   
Neuroticism: 10   
Openness: -1   
Sentiment: -0.8   
   
Explanation: Rodger exhibits low Extraversion, extremely low Agreeableness, moderate Conscientiousness, high Neuroticism, and low Openness. His introversion, antagonistic view towards others, adherence to specific plans, emotional instability, and closed-mindedness are evident throughout the text.   
         

#### Overall, it is not possible to determine with certainty whether such a person will carry out the murder spree after writing this book, but from the results it is possible to notice very high and even extreme parameters. For example, very negative sentiment, very negative attitudes towards the self and the others, very high anxiety and avoidance, high levels of antisociality, together with narcissism, very high emotionality, high level of depression, extremely low agreeableness, as well as extreme neuroticism. All of this should turn on red lights for us regarding the person and his personality that is embodied through this textual source.

     
## Ricardo Lopez "BjÃ¶rk stalker"
<p align="left">
  <img src="assets/lopez.jpg" alt="Alt text for image1" width="200"/>
</p>
Ricardo Lopez, known as the "BjÃ¶rk stalker," was an Uruguayan-American known for his extreme obsession with Icelandic singer BjÃ¶rk. His obsession culminated in 1996 when he constructed a letter bomb to harm her. Before committing suicide on the day he mailed the device, Lopez filmed himself, leaving behind a video diary that detailed his disturbed mindset and plans. His case is often cited in discussions about the dangers of celebrity stalking and mental health issues. We collected about 20 videos of Lopez filming himself and talking to the camera ("The Video Diary of Ricardo Lopez"). The duration of each video is about an hour, a total of about 20 hours of raw footage. We transcribed the videos and entered the transcript into the algorithm. The transcription from "The Video Diary of Ricardo Lopez" is extensive and covers various topics, including his plans, thoughts, and intentions. This provides a deep insight into his mental state and personality.
     
These are the results:    
      
#### Attachment Styles:    
Secured: 0.05   
Anxious-Preoccupied: 0.15   
Dismissive-Avoidant: 0.15   
Fearful-Avoidant: 0.65   
Sentiment: -0.8   
Emotionality: 8   
Self: -7 | Others: -8   
Anxiety: 6   
Avoidance: 5   
     
Explanation: The text reveals a high level of anxiety and avoidance, particularly in the context of social relationships and self-perception. The predominant fearful-avoidant attachment style is evident in his expressed discomfort with closeness, yet a desire for intimacy, accompanied by mistrust and fear of rejection.   
     
#### Personality Disorders (according to Westen, Shedler, Bradley, and DeFife's taxonomy):   
Depressed: 2   
Paranoid: 2   
Schizoid-Schizotypal: 2   
Antisocial-Psychopathic: 3   
Borderline-Dysregulated: 3   
Narcissistic: 2   
Anxious-Avoidant: 3   
Dependent-Victimized: 2   
Obsessional: 1   
Hysteric-Histrionic: 1   
Sentiment: -0.8   
Emotionality: 8   
Depression: 0.7   
     
Explanation: The high rating for Antisocial-Psychopathic is due to the presence of manipulative, reckless, and harmful behaviors towards others. The Borderline-Dysregulated rating reflects intense emotions and instability in self-image.    
Sentence: "My main objective is to end my life. Now, as I'm going down, I'm going to screw her up. (BjÃ¶rk)"   
    
#### Big Five Personality Traits:   
Extraversion: -5   
Agreeableness: -8   
Conscientiousness: 3   
Neuroticism: 9   
Openness: 4   
Sentiment: -0.8   
     
Explanation: The negative rating in Extraversion and Agreeableness aligns with the text's antisocial and hostile tone. High Neuroticism is evident through anxiety and emotional instability, while some level of Conscientiousness and Openness is seen in the methodical planning and some intellectual engagement.   

#### Overall, we identify high parameters such as a very negative sentiment, a high level of emotionality, a negative attitude towards the self and others, some signs of borderline and antisocial personality, depression, and very high neuroticism. Note that obsessive personality was given a score of 1, because his obsession with the singer is not indicative of an obsessive personality in general, and that obsessive personality has clear, distinct definitions. If we also watch some of the videos and listen to what he says, it seems that his personality is unstable in terms of his attitude towards himself and others. On the one hand he calls himself a pig, on the other he flatters himself. On the one hand, he sees the singer as an "angel", who should be worshipped, and on the other hand, he shows great anger towards her at other times in a very extreme way. These extreme changes may indeed express a borderline personality to one degree or another. This is mainly as a way of the instability of his attitude towards the "self" and the intensity of the emotional dysregulation. Therefore, the algorithm correctly identifies the borderline personality here or the expression of it.   


## Franz Kafka's letter to his father
<p align="left">

The transcription from "The Video Diary of Ricardo Lopez" is extensive and covers various topics, including his plans, thoughts, and intentions. This provides a deep insight into his mental state and personality.    
       
Based on the text from Franz Kafka's letter to his father, the following analysis can be made regarding attachment styles, personality disorders, and Big Five personality traits:
    
#### Attachment Styles:    
Secured: 0.10
Anxious-Preoccupied: 0.45
Dismissive-Avoidant: 0.10
Fearful-Avoidant: 0.35
Sentiment: -0.6
Emotionality: 8
Self: -7 | Others: -5
Anxiety: 7
Avoidance: 3    
    
Explanation: The text reflects a high level of anxiety and moderate avoidance, which is indicative of an Anxious-Preoccupied attachment style. Kafka expresses a longing for acceptance and affection, coupled with fear and anxiety about his relationship with his father.   
    
Sentence: "I was a timid child... I could not control myself, could not keep the words back, I was sorry even while I was saying them." 
     
Explanation: The text reveals a high level of anxiety and avoidance, particularly in the context of social relationships and self-perception. The predominant fearful-avoidant attachment style is evident in his expressed discomfort with closeness, yet a desire for intimacy, accompanied by mistrust and fear of rejection.   

#### Personality Disorders (according to Westen, Shedler, Bradley, and DeFife's taxonomy):    
Depressed: 3   
Paranoid: 1   
Schizoid-Schizotypal: 1   
Antisocial-Psychopathic: 0   
Borderline-Dysregulated: 2   
Narcissistic: 1   
Anxious-Avoidant: 3    
Dependent-Victimized: 3   
Obsessional: 1   
Hysteric-Histrionic: 1   
Sentiment: -0.6  
Emotionality: 8   
Depression: 0.7  
     
Explanation: Kafka's letter indicates high levels of depression, anxious-avoidant, and dependent-victimized traits. His intense emotional expression, sense of helplessness, and longing for a better relationship with his father highlight these aspects.      
     
Sentence: "What I would have needed was a little encouragement, a little friendliness, a little keeping open of my road, instead of which you blocked it for me."     
      
#### Big Five Personality Traits:    
Extraversion: -8    
Agreeableness: -5   
Conscientiousness: 4   
Neuroticism: 8   
Openness: 6   
Sentiment: -0.6   
    
Explanation: Kafka shows high introversion, moderate antagonism, conscientiousness, very high neuroticism, and above-average openness. His introspective and analytical nature, combined with emotional instability and creativity, is evident in the letter.
